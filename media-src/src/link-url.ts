// Task 390 — the link toolbar button ignored a selected URL.
//
// Selecting `https://example.com` and clicking 🔗 produced `[https://example.com](https://)`: the URL
// became the link TEXT and the destination stayed the literal placeholder, so the one thing the user
// had already supplied was the one thing the link lacked. What it must produce is the URL in BOTH
// halves — `[https://example.com](https://example.com)` — which is also the shape the user's own
// documents already carry.
//
// Consumed by the esbuild patches on vditor's `ir/process.ts` and `wysiwyg/toolbarEvent.ts` (see
// esbuild-shared.mjs) through the `__vmarkdSelectedUrl` global installed below: the patched Vditor
// sources cannot import from our bundle, and a global keeps the patch itself down to one line.

// Deliberately strict. A false positive silently rewrites a link's destination to something the user
// never typed, which is far worse than the missing convenience — so this only recognises the shapes
// that cannot be anything BUT a URL:
//   - an explicit scheme we know: http, https, mailto
//   - a bare `www.` host, which is a URL by convention everywhere and gets an https:// destination
// Anything with whitespace, a newline, or no dot in the host is ordinary text.
