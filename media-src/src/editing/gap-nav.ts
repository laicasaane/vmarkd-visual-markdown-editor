// Arrow navigation across VOID boundaries — task 292's mover, the successor to the deleted
// hr-nav.ts (task 100) and to task 496's `gapSlot`. One keydown handler owns the whole class now:
// two handlers pre-empting the same key, each with its own idea of where the caret belongs, is a
// conflict by construction, which is why hr-nav.ts was retired INTO this file, not kept beside it.
//
// The RULE lives in gap-boundary.ts (pure, unit-tested against the matrix); this file is the half
// that needs a real Range and real geometry: is the caret on the block's edge line, and where does
// the caret go. Both writes go through caret.ts's requestCaret (ADR-0007 / task 446).
