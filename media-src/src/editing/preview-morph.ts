// Block-level morph for Vditor's preview pane (task 187 item 1).
//
// Vditor's preview.render replaces the WHOLE pane via `previewElement.innerHTML = html`
// on every debounced edit settle — every rendered diagram is torn down and rebuilt
// (leaflet re-initialises its map, STL re-boots three.js, echarts re-instantiates; the
// render cache only makes the rebuild cheaper, not invisible). In sv split mode that
// happens on every typing pause. This morph splices ONLY the changed region instead.
//
// The diff is RAW-vs-RAW: the live DOM is post-processed (code swapped for svg,
// data-processed marks, re-themed colours), so comparing it against the fresh Lute
// HTML would mismatch on every diagram block even when the SOURCE is unchanged. We
// cache the raw block strings of the previous render per pane (WeakMap) and run a
// prefix/suffix two-pointer against the new ones: blocks in the common prefix/suffix
// keep their live DOM untouched (engine instances survive; afterRender's adapters
// skip them via their data-processed guards), and only the middle region is removed
// and re-inserted from the new HTML — including its interleaved whitespace text
// nodes, so the result matches what a plain innerHTML set would have produced.
//
// Fail-safe: if the pane's element children no longer match the cached raws (external
// mutation — reRender* theme flips, setValue, streaming), if the new HTML has nodes
// before its first element, or if anything throws, fall back to a plain innerHTML set
// and re-baseline.
