// ECharts charts + mindmaps are sized to the container width ONCE at init and echarts installs no
// resize handler, so they don't track later width changes — the editor's reading column settling
// AFTER init (instant-paint→live swap / iframe layout / scrollbar), or a window/pane resize. Two
// symptoms: "czasami pierwszy render za szeroki" (the column settled narrower than the init width)
// and charts not shrinking with the window.
//
// CRITICAL — we do NOT use `instance.resize()`. The chart Vditor renders has an ORPHANED instance:
// `getInstanceByDom(el)` returns null (Vditor re-creates the preview element after init, leaving a
// dead `_echarts_instance_` attr), so `resize()` is a silent no-op — which is why the previous
// window-resize + deferred-timer (`[150,450,1000,2000]`) approach never actually resized anything.
// Instead we RECONSTRUCT from the source JSON at the current container width (reconstructCharts /
// reconstructMindmaps in echarts-retheme.ts) — proven in the real editor to fix a stuck canvas.
//
// Trigger = a ResizeObserver on each chart/mindmap container (the only thing that fires exactly when
// the reading column settles — a width change is a LAYOUT change, not a DOM mutation, so the old
// timers guessed and a MutationObserver can't see it). rAF-coalesced. The reconstruct* are dedupe-
// guarded (skip when the canvas already fits its container, skip hidden 0-width), so a mode switch
// (width unchanged / pane hidden) does NOT reconstruct → no "tekst w tle" flicker (the trap that
// killed the earlier ResizeObserver-that-called-resize()). A window 'resize' listener (trailing
// debounce) is kept as a belt-and-suspenders path (also dedupe-guarded, so it's a no-op when nothing
// changed). mindmap INITIAL render is still handled by observeMindmaps (a MutationObserver — it fires
// on the DOM mutation when Vditor first draws the canvas).
