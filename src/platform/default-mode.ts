// Task 282 — which editor mode a document OPENS in. Until now this was hardcoded `ir`
// (vditor-init.ts) with only the session-persisted saved-options override on top, so a user who
// reads far more than they write had no way to say "open in Preview" other than clicking every
// time. Resolution happens HOST-side, in one place, and ships a single already-resolved value to
// the webview: the glob match needs the document's workspace-relative path, which the webview does
// not have, and keeping the precedence here makes it unit-testable against the config mock.

// for are the `docs/**` / `**/*.spec.md` shape. Supported: `**` (any depth, crosses `/`), `*` (any
// run within ONE path segment), `?` (one non-separator char). Everything else is literal.
