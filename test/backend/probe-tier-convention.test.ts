// Task 449's `@probe` tier (test/vscode-e2e/playwright.config.ts's `grepExcludePatterns`) is
// enforced by TWO independent conventions that must agree:
//   - the `@probe` tag in a test() title (the mechanism that actually excludes a test, same
//     precedent as the pre-existing `@visual` tag), and
//   - a `*-probe.spec.ts` filename (a readable signal for anyone scanning the directory, so a
//     spec that forgets the tag is still visually flagged).
//
// A file can drift off either convention without the other noticing — team-lead hit BOTH
// directions before this guard existed:
//   - `caret-empty-typing-probe.spec.ts` carried real regression assertions under a probe NAME
//     (renamed off the convention once found — a filename-says-probe, content-is-real mismatch).
//   - `undo-dirty-probe.spec.ts` is a real SMOKE-tier assertion spec with a historical probe name
//     that was never a measurement-only probe to begin with.
// Both are "someone reads the filename and silently drops a real gate" — the failure this guard
// exists to make impossible, in either direction, without needing a VS Code boot to check it.
//
// No VS Code boot: this is pure text/regex over the spec SOURCE, not `import()` of the specs
// themselves (they import 'vscode-test-playwright', which isn't installed for the root vitest
// run — see test/vscode-e2e's separate node_modules).

// Direction A exceptions: a `*-probe.spec.ts` FILE that is intentionally NOT tag-excluded,
// because — despite its name — it carries real assertions that must stay in the default run.
// Declaring an exception here is the point: the next reader sees WHY, instead of discovering a
// missing gate by debugging a regression that silently stopped running.

}

// Direction B exceptions: a file carrying `@probe`-tagged tests whose name does NOT end in
// `-probe.spec.ts`. Two shapes:
//   - task 449's original tagging pass predates the `*-probe.spec.ts` filename convention (that
//     convention was added by team-lead AFTER 449 landed) and reused the existing `@visual`
//     precedent — tag-only, no filename rule — so these names were never meant to carry "-probe".
//   - `probe-cloudogu.spec.ts` / `probe-pumlmode.spec.ts` carry "probe" as a PREFIX, not a suffix,
//     so they deliberately do not match the `*-probe.spec.ts` glob.
// Renaming any of these to satisfy the suffix convention was considered and rejected: several
// (`mermaid-markers`, `diagram-edit-scroll`) mix a probe-tagged test with other content, so a
// blanket "-probe" rename would misdescribe the file; a rename also breaks every doc/comment that
// already names them (18 header comments added in task 449) for no safety gain — see Direction B's
// own purpose below.
